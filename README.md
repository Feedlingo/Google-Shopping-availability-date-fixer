# Feedlingo Google-Shopping availability_date fixer


**Feedlingo Availability-Date Fixer** is a lightweight, self-hosted PHP tool that automatically generates a **Google Shopping supplemental feed** for products that are not in stock yet.

Many shops don’t know the exact delivery date for **preorder** or **backorder** products – but Google Merchant Center **requires** an `availability_date` for these items. This tool solves that problem by automatically creating a supplemental feed where

```text
availability_date = today + N days (UTC)
```

You keep full control over the offset (e.g. 5, 10, 30 days) while still providing a valid date to Google.

---

## What it does

- Reads your **main product feed** (XML or CSV)
- Filters out all products with `availability = in stock`
- Keeps only products with any other availability (e.g. `preorder`, `backorder`, `out of stock`, …)
- Writes a separate **Google RSS supplemental feed** containing:
  - `g:id`
  - `g:availability`
  - `g:availability_date` (auto-calculated)
- Designed to be called via **cronjob** (daily or more often)
- Also offers a **Test run** button in the UI to manually trigger a generation

---

## Supported input formats

### 1. XML (Google Shopping style)

Example (main feed):

```xml
<rss xmlns:g="http://base.google.com/ns/1.0" version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <item>
      <g:id>SKU-123</g:id>
      <g:availability>preorder</g:availability>
      ...
    </item>
  </channel>
</rss>
```

The tool tries to parse this format first (`rss/channel/item` or `feed/entry`).

### 2. CSV

If XML parsing fails, the tool automatically falls back to CSV parsing.

Requirements:

- A header row
- One column for the product ID
- One column for the availability

Accepted column names (case-insensitive):

- ID: `id`, `g:id`, `item_id`, `item id`, `product_id`, `product id`
- Availability: `availability`, `g:availability`, `availability_status`, `stock_status`, …

Both `,` and `;` are supported as delimiters (auto-detected).

Example CSV:

```csv
id,availability,title
SKU-123,preorder,Some product
SKU-456,in stock,Another product
```

`SKU-456` will be ignored in the supplemental feed because it’s `in stock`.

---

## Output format (supplemental feed)

The tool generates a **clean Google RSS feed** like this:

```xml
<rss xmlns:g="http://base.google.com/ns/1.0" version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <title>Feedlingo Availability Supplemental Feed</title>
    <link>https://www.your-shop.com/</link>
    <description>Automatically generated supplemental feed for availability_date</description>

    <item>
      <g:id>SKU-123</g:id>
      <g:availability>preorder</g:availability>
      <g:availability_date>2025-12-31T00:00:00Z</g:availability_date>
    </item>
  </channel>
</rss>
```

You then add this file as a **supplemental feed** in Google Merchant Center and link it via the **ID** field to your main feed.

---

## Requirements

- PHP **5.6 or higher**  
- `DOM`, `SimpleXML` and `json` extensions (standard in most PHP installations)
- Webserver (Apache, Nginx, …) or CLI PHP with `php -S`

No external API, no database, no Composer, no framework.

---

## Installation

1. Copy `feedlingo_availability_date_fixer.php` to a directory on your webserver, e.g.:

   ```text
   /var/www/html/feedlingo_availability_date_fixer.php
   ```

2. Make sure the webserver user can **write** in that directory  
   (the script will create `feedlingo_availability_config.json` and the supplemental XML file).

3. Open the script in your browser, for example:

   ```text
   https://yourserver.com/feedlingo_availability_date_fixer.php
   ```

4. Configure:

   - **Source feed**: URL or path of your main Google Shopping feed (XML or CSV)
   - **Target file**: path where the supplemental feed should be written, e.g.

     ```text
     /var/www/html/feeds/availability_supplement.xml
     ```

   - **Availability date offset** (days)
   - **Shop base URL** (used as `<link>` in the RSS `<channel>`)

5. Click **Save configuration**.

---

## Test run (manual)

The UI includes a **“Run test now”** button.

- It uses the current configuration
- Immediately generates the supplemental feed
- Shows a result message like:

  ```text
  Test run finished: OK (xml): 42 products → /var/www/html/feeds/availability_supplement.xml (availability_date = 2025-12-31T00:00:00Z)
  ```

Use this before setting up the cronjob to verify that:

- The source feed is readable
- The CSV columns map correctly
- The target file is writable

---

## Cronjob usage

Once the configuration is correct, you can set up a cronjob that calls:

```text
https://yourserver.com/feedlingo_availability_date_fixer.php?run=1&secret=YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
```

The UI shows the exact URL in the **Cronjob URL** box.

### Linux cron example

```cron
0 5 * * * /usr/bin/wget -qO- "https://yourserver.com/feedlingo_availability_date_fixer.php?run=1&secret=YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN"   > /var/log/feedlingo_availability.log 2>&1
```

This runs the generator every day at 05:00, updates the supplemental feed and logs the output.

---

## Security

- A random **secret token** is generated on first run.
- The cron endpoint (`?run=1&secret=...`) will return `403` if the secret is missing or wrong.
- You can click **Regenerate secret** in the UI to invalidate old cron URLs.

For extra safety, you can also:
- Restrict access to the script using HTTP auth or IP allow-lists.
- Place it in a protected backend area of your server.

---

## Use case summary

This tool is ideal if:

- Your shop or ERP can only export a **basic feed** (XML/CSV) without `availability_date`.
- You have many **preorder / backorder** products where manual date maintenance is impossible.
- You want a **simple, local, transparent** solution without external SaaS dependencies.
- You need **Google Shopping compliance** for availability rules with minimum effort.
